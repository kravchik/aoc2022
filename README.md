# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

A beautiful set of interesting tasks accompanied by the merry Christmas story.

My solutions to all tasks are implemented in **Java**, in one class each.

Each class usually contains several tests: test1, and test2 are for examples; answer1 and answer2 are solutions for part 1 and part 2. Everything with asserts to catch a bug after refactorings.

## Interesting sum-ups.

### Day 16.
After several iterations, I managed to solve Part2 in 4 seconds. The main improvements are from early pruning "is this state could possibly better than already accepted best if all remaining valves are magically opened?".
